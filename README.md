# Challenge

This is the challenge for week 1. we were tasked with refactoring code and committing the files to our repository.

#User Story
As a blind person I want all images to read my a description of the photo.  

##Challenges
Added alt="" to all images creating accessibility
Updated Html Syntax
Removed non-symantic html within the tags of the html
Fixed semantic layering removing and combining sections that were redundant when able to.

##Demo
